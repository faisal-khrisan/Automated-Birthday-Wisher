Subject: Another Year Older… and Wiser? 😂🎉

Hey [Name],

Happy Birthday, you legend! 🎂🎉 Another year older, but don’t worry—you’re still as young (or as old 😜) as you feel! May your cake be sweet, your presents be plenty, and your wrinkles be non-existent.

Have a fantastic day, and don’t forget to save me a slice of cake! 🎈

Cheers,

Faisal
